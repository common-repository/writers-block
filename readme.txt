Writer's Block uses the GrepWords.com API to make content suggestions based on keywords. Coming up with content ideas has never been easier.

== Description ==
Writer's Block is powered by the GrepWords API. In order to use the plug-in, you will need to have a GrepWords API key.

Writer's Block helps you find great content suggestions for your next blog post. Simply type in a keyword or pipe-separated keywords to get recommendations of questions people are asking related to that content. Use those questions as the fuel for writing great new content.

For example, if you were to type in "garden", you would get article title recommendations like...

"How to build a raised garden box"

Use the tool to find inspiration on those days when you just can't figure out what to write.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the writers-block folder to the plugins directory
2. Activate the plugin through the plugins menu in WordPress.
3. Add your API Key in the Content Suggestions settings page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
